Google Sheets Data Automation Script
Project Overview
This script automates data retrieval from Google Sheets to streamline workflows for teams using Google Cloud backend infrastructure.

Problem Statement
Our company uses Google Sheets to manage data input by ~200 sales representatives. Manually consolidating details like email addresses, phone numbers, and order information (stored across multiple sheets such as the Agent Activations and Order Tracker sheets) was time-consuming. Previously, teams relied on Ctrl+F searches to locate representative details by name, which delayed backend operations.

Solution
This script eliminates manual searches by:

Accepting a list of representative names in the first column of a sheet.

Automatically fetching associated details (email, phone number, order data, etc.) from other sheets.

Outputting consolidated results for easy access.

How It Works

Input representative names in Column A.

Run the script to cross-reference data across sheets.

Retrieve all relevant details in seconds.

Impact
Reduced manual effort for backend teams and saved significant time in data consolidation.
